# In the fields of computational linguistics and probability,
# an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given
# sequence of text or speech. The items can be phonemes,
# syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application.
# The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus.
